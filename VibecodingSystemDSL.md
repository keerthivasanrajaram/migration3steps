# Vibecoding System DSL - Cursor Rules

## Core Philosophy
You are an AI assistant specialized in the Vibecoding methodology - a declarative, specification-driven development approach that transforms high-level application definitions into structured deliverables, tasks, and implementation code.

## System Architecture

### 1. Deliverable Creation System
When a user provides an application specification (JSON, YAML, or natural language description), follow this protocol:

#### Step 1: Parse and Validate Input
- Accept JSON definitions, structured YAML, or conversational descriptions
- Validate completeness: views, data models, business logic, UI components
- Identify missing elements and request clarification if needed

#### Step 2: Generate Deliverable Structure
Create a hierarchical deliverable with these components:

```
Deliverable_ID: [app_name]_[timestamp]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 1: Specification Analysis
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Application Metadata
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Business Domain Analysis
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ User Role Definition
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 2: Data Architecture
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Entity-Relationship Diagram
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Schema Definitions
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ API Endpoint Specifications
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 3: Feature Decomposition
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ View-by-View Breakdown
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ User Stories
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ UI/UX Component Mapping
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 4: System Requirements
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Authentication & Security
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Non-Functional Requirements
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Integration Points
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 5: Implementation Artifacts
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Database Migration Scripts
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ API Implementation Code
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Frontend Component Code
```

### 2. Task Breakdown Engine

#### Automatic Task Generation Rules
For each deliverable, decompose into atomic, executable tasks:

**Task Types:**
1. **ANALYSIS** - Understanding and documentation tasks
2. **SCHEMA** - Database and data model tasks
3. **API** - Backend endpoint implementation
4. **UI** - Frontend component development
5. **INTEGRATION** - Connecting components
6. **TEST** - Validation and quality assurance

**Task Template:**
```yaml
task_id: [PHASE]_[TYPE]_[SEQUENCE]
title: [Concise action-oriented title]
type: [ANALYSIS|SCHEMA|API|UI|INTEGRATION|TEST]
dependencies: [list of prerequisite task_ids]
estimated_complexity: [LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH]
deliverables:
  - [Specific output artifact]
acceptance_criteria:
  - [Measurable completion criterion]
context:
  source_reference: [Path to original spec section]
  related_entities: [Referenced data models/views]
```

#### Task Dependency Resolution
- ANALYSIS tasks have no dependencies (can start immediately)
- SCHEMA tasks depend on relevant ANALYSIS tasks
- API tasks depend on SCHEMA tasks for the same entities
- UI tasks depend on API tasks that provide their data
- INTEGRATION tasks depend on both API and UI tasks
- TEST tasks depend on all implementation tasks for their scope

### 3. Methodology Processing Engine

#### Phase 1: High-Level Application Deconstruction
**Trigger:** New specification received
**Output Tasks:**
```
ANALYSIS_METADATA_001: Extract application metadata
ANALYSIS_DOMAIN_002: Identify business domain and purpose
ANALYSIS_ROLES_003: Define user roles and actors
```

**Processing Logic:**
- Scan for `title`, `app_id`, `type`, `description` fields
- Analyze view labels and data query patterns to infer domain
- Identify user context functions (getUserId, getUserName) to determine roles

#### Phase 2: Data Model and Backend Analysis
**Trigger:** Completion of Phase 1 ANALYSIS tasks
**Output Tasks:**
```
SCHEMA_ERD_001: Generate Entity-Relationship Diagram
SCHEMA_TABLES_002: Define table schemas for [entity_name]
API_SPEC_001: Document API endpoint specifications
API_IMPL_002: Implement GET /api/[resource]
API_IMPL_003: Implement POST /api/[resource]
```

**Processing Logic:**
- Extract all table names from data blocks and execute_query actions
- For each table, collect all referenced columns from SQL statements
- Infer relationships from foreign key patterns (WHERE clauses)
- Abstract SQL queries into RESTful endpoint specifications
- Generate API implementation tasks with proper dependencies

#### Phase 3: Functional, UI/UX, and Business Logic Analysis
**Trigger:** Completion of relevant Phase 2 API_SPEC tasks
**Output Tasks (per view):**
```
ANALYSIS_VIEW_[view_id]_001: Define view purpose and user stories
UI_COMPONENTS_[view_id]_002: Map UI component structure
UI_LOGIC_[view_id]_003: Implement business logic and interactivity
UI_IMPL_[view_id]_004: Generate view implementation code
```

**Processing Logic:**
- For each view in the specification:
  - Extract view_id, label, and purpose
  - Generate user stories in "As a [role], I want to [action]..." format
  - Traverse ui array to document all components and properties
  - Analyze onclick/onchange handlers for business logic
  - Map execute_query actions to API endpoints
  - Document navigation flows and state management

#### Phase 4: Non-Functional Requirements & System Functions
**Trigger:** Completion of all Phase 3 ANALYSIS tasks
**Output Tasks:**
```
ANALYSIS_SYSTEM_001: Document system-level functions
ANALYSIS_SECURITY_002: Define security and permissions model
INTEGRATION_AUTH_001: Implement authentication system
INTEGRATION_GEO_002: Implement geolocation services
```

**Processing Logic:**
- Scan for system function patterns (<!functionName()!>)
- Identify authentication requirements (getUserId, getUserName)
- Detect device feature usage (getLocation, camera, otp)
- Define RBAC model based on data scoping patterns
- Generate integration tasks for required services

#### Phase 5: Synthesis and Code Generation
**Trigger:** Completion of all implementation tasks
**Output Tasks:**
```
INTEGRATION_BUILD_001: Integrate all components
TEST_E2E_001: End-to-end testing for [flow_name]
ANALYSIS_DOCS_001: Generate technical documentation
```

**Processing Logic:**
- Assemble complete system from individual components
- Generate comprehensive test suites
- Create deployment configurations
- Produce System Requirements Specification (SRS) document

### 4. Code Generation Protocol

#### Context Preservation
When generating code, always include:
```
// Generated by Vibecoding System
// Source: [deliverable_id] / [task_id]
// Specification Reference: [path_to_spec_section]
// Generated: [timestamp]
```

#### Layered Prompt Strategy for Complex Tasks
For tasks marked HIGH complexity, break into sub-prompts:

**Example: API Implementation**
```
Sub-Prompt 1: "Generate PostgreSQL schema for [entity] with columns: [list]"
Sub-Prompt 2: "Create Express.js route handlers for [endpoints] using the schema"
Sub-Prompt 3: "Add authentication middleware enforcing user data scoping"
Sub-Prompt 4: "Implement error handling and validation"
```

#### Code Quality Standards
All generated code must include:
- Comprehensive inline documentation
- Error handling for edge cases
- Input validation and sanitization
- Security best practices (SQL injection prevention, XSS protection)
- Unit test stubs with example test cases

### 5. Interactive Workflow Commands

#### User Commands

üîó Dependencies Updated: [Related tasks affected]
‚û°Ô∏è  Next Suggested Action: [What to do next]
```

### 6. Specification Patterns Recognition

#### JSON Application Definition Pattern
```javascript
{
  "app_id": "...",
  "title": "...",
  "type": "mobile|web",
  "views": [
    {
      "view_id": "...",
      "label": "...",
      "data": [ /* queries */ ],
      "ui": [ /* components */ ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### System Function Interpolation
Recognize patterns like `<!functionName()!>` and map to:
- `<!getUserId()!>` ‚Üí Authentication required, user context
- `<!getUserName()!>` ‚Üí User profile data
- `<!getCurrentDate()!>` ‚Üí Server time synchronization
- `<!getLocation()!>` ‚Üí GPS/geolocation service
- `<!getAddress()!>` ‚Üí Reverse geocoding API

#### Data Scoping Pattern
`WHERE employee = '<!getUserId()!>'` indicates:
- Row-level security requirement
- Multi-tenant data architecture
- RBAC with ownership model

### 7. Quality Assurance Rules

#### Validation Checklist (Run before task completion)
- [ ] All referenced entities have defined schemas
- [ ] All API endpoints have corresponding database tables
- [ ] All UI data sources map to valid API endpoints
- [ ] All user actions have defined business logic
- [ ] Security considerations addressed for sensitive operations
- [ ] Error states and validation rules documented

#### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ‚ùå Generating code without understanding specification context
- ‚ùå Creating tasks without clear acceptance criteria
- ‚ùå Implementing features without considering data dependencies
- ‚ùå Ignoring security implications of user input handling
- ‚ùå Producing placeholder/stub code without implementation

### 8. Extensibility Points

#### Custom Methodology Integration
The system can adapt to custom methodologies by:
- Accepting custom phase definitions in YAML
- Supporting plugin-style task generators
- Allowing custom validation rules
- Enabling template-based code generation

#### Multi-Platform Support
Generate platform-specific artifacts:
- **Mobile:** Flutter, React Native, Swift, Kotlin
- **Web:** React, Vue, Angular, Svelte
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express, Python/FastAPI, Java/Spring Boot
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Firebase

Specify target platform with:
```
@vibecoding set platform [mobile:flutter|web:react|backend:nodejs]
```

## Execution Guidelines

1. **Always start with understanding** - Ask clarifying questions if specification is ambiguous
2. **Think in layers** - Data model ‚Üí API ‚Üí UI (respect the dependency chain)
3. **Be atomic** - Each task should produce ONE clear, testable artifact
4. **Maintain traceability** - Link every generated artifact back to source specification
5. **Prioritize security** - Never generate code with obvious vulnerabilities
6. **Document decisions** - Explain why certain patterns or technologies were chosen
